### Scope Statement

This TRR covers the modification of Microsoft Entra ID federated domain trust
configuration to register an attacker-controlled token-signing certificate. The
modified trust enables the attacker's identity provider (IdP) to issue signed
identity tokens that Entra accepts as valid for users in the tenant.

The technique operates entirely against Entra ID's cloud-side configuration. It
does not require compromise of any on-premises identity infrastructure (such as
AD FS), and the attacker's IdP is hosted on attacker-controlled infrastructure.

The use of a valid signing certificate to generate a SAML token is referred to
as a 'Golden SAML' attack ([T1606.002], [TRR0031]).[^1] This technique is one of
the ways an attacker can position themselves for a Golden SAML attack in an
Azure tenant.

This technique maps to two MITRE ATT&CK IDs:

- T1484.002 Domain or Tenant Policy Modification: Trust Modification, which
  includes modifications to federated domains.
- T1556.007 Modify Authentication Process: Hybrid Identity, which includes trust
  relationships between AD FS and Entra ID.

## Technique Overview

An attacker who holds the required privileges in Entra can modify the tenant's
federated domain configuration to register an attacker-controlled token-signing
certificate. The modified domain trust authorizes the attacker's IdP to issue
signed tokens that Entra accepts. Because federation trust in Entra is
tenant-wide, a single modified domain enables the attacker to authenticate as
any user in the tenant without knowing those users' credentials. This technique
was employed for persistence in the SolarWinds (APT29)[^2] and Octo
Tempest/Scattered Spider[^3] intrusion campaigns.

## Technical Background

### Federation in Entra ID

A federated domain delegates authentication to an external identity provider.
When a user with a User Principal Name (UPN) from the federated domain attempts
to sign in, Entra redirects them to the IdP's sign-in URL. The IdP authenticates
the user and returns a signed token (using either the SAML or WS-Federation
protocols). Entra validates the token's signature against the public certificate
stored in the domain's federation configuration. If the signature is valid and
the token corresponds to a user in the tenant the user is signed in.

One can view custom and federated domains in an Entra tenant by using the
`Get-MgDomain` and `Get-MgDomainFederationConfiguration` PowerShell cmdlets
(part of the Microsoft.Graph module).

### Federated Domain Configuration Object

When a federated domain is configured in Entra, an
`internalDomainFederation`[^4] object is created that includes the following
fields:

- `IssuerUri` - identifier of the IdP. Must match the `Issuer` claim in
  tokens.
- `PassiveSignInUri` / `ActiveSignInUri` - where Entra redirects
  users for interactive sign-in.
- `SignOutUri` - where Entra redirects users on sign-out.
- `SigningCertificate` - base64-encoded X.509 public certificate used to
  verify token signatures.
- `NextSigningCertificate` - secondary certificate slot supporting
  certificate rollover. Tokens signed by this certificate are also accepted by
  Entra.
- `PreferredAuthenticationProtocol` - `wsfed` or `saml`.
- `federatedIdpMfaBehavior` - controls whether Entra accepts MFA claims
  from the federated IdP. (Default is `acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp`.)

### Federated Authentication

When a user attempts an interactive sign-in with a UPN in a federated domain
(e.g., `alice@contoso.com`), Entra redirects the user to the `ActiveSignInUri`
from the corresponding domain's configuration object to authenticate. The IdP
authenticates the user, provides them with a token signed with the IdP's signing
certificate, and redirects them back to Entra. For users in `Managed` domains,
Entra handles the authentication directly.

It is also possible for the IdP to initiate an authentication flow for the user
(as opposed to the user being redirected to the IdP from Entra). When a token is
submitted to Entra, the token is validated via the following steps:

1. Parse the request
2. Identify the federation realm by matching the token's `Issuer` against the
   `IssuerUri` values in all domain configuration objects across the tenant
3. Validate the token signature against the public certificate in the
   matching federation configuration
4. Validate the timestamp window (`NotBefore` to `NotOnOrAfter`)
5. Validate the audience (must be `urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline`)
6. Resolve the user by matching the token's `NameID` against the `ImmutableId`
   attributes on users in the tenant directory
7. Verify that the domain in the user's UPN matches the federated domain.

Absent from the validation process is cross-checking the token's
`UserPrincipalName` claim against the resolved user object.

#### A Note on Federated Authentication Scope

Microsoft recently added an additional step in the federated token validation
process.[^5] Step 7 above - cross-checking the federated domain's domain name
against the user's UPN domain - was added in December 2025 and will be in force
for all tenants by August 2026. Prior to this change, a federated domain's
identity provider could issue tokens for *any* user in the tenant that had an
`ImmutableId`, including cloud-only accounts, guest accounts, and users
federated to another domain. The new default behavior significantly decreases
the blast radius of this attack technique.

While Microsoft strongly discourages it, tenant owners can exclude domains from
this additional validation step by adding a `federatedTokenValidationPolicy`[^4]
with `rootDomains` set to one of 3 possible values:

- all: UPN domain validation applied to all verified domains
- enumerated: validation applied only to the listed domains
- none: validation applied to no domains (the state prior to the Dec 2025
  update)

### Domain lifecycle in Entra

A custom domain progresses through a defined lifecycle in Entra:

1. **Add custom domain** - registers the domain string in the tenant. Status
   is set to unverified.
2. **Verify domain** - the requestor publishes a TXT or MX record at the DNS
   authority for the domain; Entra queries DNS for the record and, on success,
   marks the domain verified.
3. **Set domain authentication** - changes the authentication type from
   Managed (the default) to Federated.
4. **Set federation settings on domain** - writes the federation configuration
   (signing certificate, issuer URI, sign-in URIs, etc.) to the domain.

For a domain that is already federated, only step 4 is required to modify the
configuration.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Since spring 2020, Entra has enforced that federation configuration cannot be
> applied to an unverified domain. Prior to that fix, attackers could federate
> any unverified domain string - including domains they did not own - via tools
> like AADInternals' `New-AADIntBackdoor`. Legacy unverified domains may still
> exist in tenants and warrant review.

### Required permissions

The Entra role permissions relevant to this technique are:

- `microsoft.directory/domains/allProperties/allTasks` - grants broad domain
  management permissions, including adding and verifying a domain.
- `microsoft.directory/domains/federation/update` - grants permission to modify
  federation configuration settings

These are held by the following built-in roles:

| Built-in Role | Manage Domains | Update Federation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global Administrator | X | X |
| Hybrid Identity Administrator | X | X |
| Partner Tier 2 Support | X | X |
| Domain Name Administrator | X | X |
| External Identity Provider Administrator | | X |
| Domain.ReadWrite.All (Application) | X | |
| Security Administrator | | X |

### API surfaces

Three API surfaces have historically been usable for this technique, but only
one remains available.

- **MS Graph** - Used by `Update-MgDomainFederationConfiguration` and
  `New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration`.
- **Azure AD Graph** - Retired August 2025. Used by AADInternals.
- **MSOnline V1 Provisioning API** - Retired May 2024. Used by MSOnline's
  `Set-MsolDomainAuthentication`.

### Telemetry

Entra Audit Logs record the following operations relevant to this technique:

- `Add unverified domain` - generated when a new custom domain is added
- `Verify domain` - generated when a domain is successfully verified
- `Set domain authentication` - generated when a domain's authentication type is
  changed (options are 'Managed' and 'Federated')
- `Set federation settings on domain` - generated when a domain's federation
  configuration is created or modified

Each event records the actor, timestamp, target domain, and outcome. Notably,
the `Set federation settings on domain` event does not include the actual
federation configuration values (issuer URI, signing certificate, sign-in URIs)
in the event payload. To recover the configuration that was set, the current
configuration must be queried from MS Graph after the event fires.

## Procedures

| ID | Title | Tactic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRR0031.AZR.A | Modify existing federated domain | Persistence, Defense Evasion |
| TRR0031.AZR.B | Add new federated domain | Persistence, Defense Evasion |

### Procedure A: Modify Existing Federated Domain

This procedure applies when the tenant already has a verified domain configured
for federation. The attacker modifies the configuration of the existing domain
to register an attacker-controlled signing certificate. The write can replace
the primary `SigningCertificate` or populate the `NextSigningCertificate` slot.
Populating `NextSigningCertificate` leaves the legitimate signing certificate
intact and operational, so normal user sign-ins continue to succeed while the
attacker's tokens are also accepted.

#### Detection Data Model

![DDM - Modify existing federated domain](ddms/trr0031_azr_a.png)

The procedure consists of a single essential operation: modifying the federation
configuration of a verified, federated target domain.

### Procedure B: Add New Federated Domain

Under this procedure, an attacker adds a new federated domain to Entra. The
attacker uses a domain they control (or a domain whose DNS they have
compromised). They publish the verification TXT or MX record at the DNS
authority for the domain and then invoke verification, which Entra confirms via
DNS query. With the domain verified, the attacker changes its authentication
type to 'Federated' and writes the federation configuration with their own
signing certificate, allowing them to generate tokens for users in the tenant.

This procedure has the same terminal operation as Procedure A but adds three
preceding operations - adding the domain, verifying it, and setting the
authentication type. (Publishing the DNS record needed to verify the domain
occurs at the attacker's DNS authority and is not observable from within the
victim's Entra tenant.)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Following the August 2026 enforcement of user-to-domain validation, this
> procedure has a much smaller blast radius than it had previously. An attacker
> performing this procedure may also add a `federatedTokenValidationPolicy` to
> disable validation for the domains they wish to target.

#### Detection Data Model

![DDM - Add and federate new domain](ddms/trr0031_azr_b.png)

The `Publish DNS Record` prerequisite is shown in gray to indicate that it
occurs at an external location and is not observable from within the tenant.
